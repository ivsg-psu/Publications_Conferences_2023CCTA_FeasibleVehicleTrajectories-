<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Simulating a vehicle’s motion within a road network has many applications, including autonomous vehicle development and transportation planning. These simulations are expected to include not only predictions of an ego vehicle’s behavior, but also interactions with other vehicles, changing rules-of-road, and environmental factors. Some of these interactions are best predicted by vehicle chassis models and simulations, such as the friction utilization of a vehicle on a roadway in changing weather. However, other interactions, such as between vehicles and the rules-of-road or between the ego vehicle and other large groups of vehicles, are best predicted by traffic simulations. As well, the management of data between traffic and chassis simulations can be difficult due to the large number of vehicles and geographic scale in which they operate. There is a need for methods to integrate these toolsets with each other to where the synergistic function of the tools achieves research needs. This paper identifies a particular gap in functionality between traffic simulations and chassis simulations: that traffic simulations predict infeasible vehicle trajectories from the standpoint of vehicle chassis behavior. This study proposes solutions, and the adapted hybrid simulation method is shown to be capable of providing physically realistic chassis data for individual vehicles operating in larger road networks with network-scale interactions between vehicles.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Installation

1.  Make sure to run MATLAB 2020b or higher

2. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/ivsg-psu/Publications_Conferences_2023CCTA_FeasibleVehicleTrajectories
   ```
3. Download the datafiles from <a href="https://pennstateoffice365.sharepoint.com/sites/IntelligentVehiclesandSystemsGroup-Active/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?ga=1&id=%2Fsites%2FIntelligentVehiclesandSystemsGroup%2DActive%2FShared%20Documents%2FIVSG%2FGitHubMirror%2FPublications%2FConferences%2F2023%2FPublications%5FConferences%5F2023CCTA%5FRoadNetworkFrictionAnalysis&viewid=aa025233%2D06cc%2D49ea%2Dbed2%2Db847e0f89798"><strong>psu-ivsg data cetner</strong></a> into the /Data folder.

### Generate plots of a vehicle ID on a specific section ID
1. Download the datafiles from <a href=""><strong>psu-ivsg data center</strong></a> into the /Data folder. 

2. In the main script, set the variables 'section_ID' and 'vehicle_ID'
   ```sh
   script_createRealisticTrajectories_SCE_3DoFPPC.m
   ```
   Reference trajectory data has been provided for 8 section IDs:
   Section 3905:
   - Set vehicle_id = 2 to analyze a lane change trajectory
   - Set vehicle_id = 3 to analyze a no lane change trajectory
   Section 8242:
   - Set vehicle_id = 2 to analyze a lane change trajectory
   - Set vehicle_id = 3 to analyze a no lane change trajectory
   Section 8859: Arterial driving, Route 322 Offramp
   - Set vehicle_id = 2 to analyze a lane change trajectory
   - Set vehicle_id = 3 to analyze a no lane change trajectory
   Section 8860:
   - Set vehicle_id = 2 to analyze a lane change trajectory
   - Set vehicle_id = 3 to analyze a no lane change trajectory
   Section 8938: Highway driving, Interstate 99
   - Set vehicle_id = 2 to analyze a lane change trajectory
   - Set vehicle_id = 3 to analyze a no lane change trajectory
   Section 14479:
   - Set vehicle_id = 2 to analyze a lane change trajectory
   - Set vehicle_id = 3 to analyze a no lane change trajectory
   Section 19343: Urban driving, traffic light intersection in downtown State College
   - Set vehicle_id = 2 to analyze a lane change trajectory
   - Set vehicle_id = 3 to analyze a no lane change trajectory
   Section 37162: Urban driving, traffic light intersection with 4 lanes of traffic
   - Set vehicle_id = 2 to analyze a lane change trajectory
   - Set vehicle_id = 3 to analyze a no lane change trajectory
